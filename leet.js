// Step 2: If there are still cards in the deck, you should place the next top card at the bottom of the deck.

// Step 3: If any cards remain unseen, return to step 1. Otherwise, proceed to the end.

// Step 4: Return a deck order that reveals the cards in increasing order.

  // To be competely honest we worked together on this as a group.  Spent almost the entire day.  Didn't always get the same solution and I did a lot of google searching and video watching.  No way I would have came up with the solutions I did on my own. Or if I would have came up with a solution at all.
